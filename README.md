Misirlou's simple PHP backend. The juicy stuff is mostly in methods.

To get started, simply copy config.sample.php to config.php, and edit the
values in `$config`. Everything should be pretty obvious and need no
explanation.

Done that, create/update the database schema by running from the command line
`migrate.php`.
